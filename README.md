# D3 Node Graph

This project includes an interactive D3.js node graph visualizing various frontend, backend, and design technologies. The graph features:

- **Nodes**: Each technology is represented as a node with a unique size and color based on its value and topic.
- **Topics**: Nodes are categorized into topics such as Frontend, Backend, Design, CMS, etc., and connected to related nodes.
- **Responsiveness**: The graph is fully responsive and adjusts well to small screens.
- **Accessibility**: The text associated with each node is ADA-friendly, with enhanced contrast, letter-spacing, and clear fonts for improved readability.

## Features

- **Interactive Nodes**: You can drag and move nodes around to explore the graph.
- **Customizable Relationships**: Nodes are linked based on common relationships between technologies.
- **Text Accessibility**: Node labels are ADA compliant with larger font sizes, letter-spacing, and bold text for better visibility.
  
## How to Run

To run this project, follow these steps:
